<h1>Stock Market Prediction Using Machine Learning</h1>

👉Summary

A machine learning project that analyzes historical stock market data to predict future stock prices using supervised learning models.


👉 Problem Statement

This project aims to:

Analyze historical stock price data

Train a machine learning model

Predict future stock price movements based on learned patterns

No hype — just statistical learning.

📊 Dataset

Typical Features:

Date

Open Price

High Price

Low Price

Close Price

Volume

Target Variable:

Closing Price / Future Price

👉 Used Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Libraries Used: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib / Seaborn, Scikit‑learn 

No unnecessary frameworks. Clean and practical.

👉 Methods / Approach

 Data Loading

 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

 Train‑Test Split (typically 80/20)

 Model Training (Regression‑based ML model)

 Model Evaluation (R² score / error metrics)

 Prediction & Visualization


💡 Key Insights

Stock prices show strong time‑series dependency

Volume often correlates with price volatility

Machine learning models can capture non‑linear patterns better than manual analysis

Actual vs Predicted Price plots


Trend visualization over time

Model performance metrics (R² Score, error values)

👉 Results & Conclusion

The trained model successfully learns historical patterns

Achieves reasonable prediction accuracy on test data

Demonstrates the usefulness of ML in financial data analysis


🚀 Future Work

Add LSTM / GRU for time‑series modeling

Include technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Moving Averages)

Integrate real‑time data using APIs

Deploy as a web app (Streamlit / Flask)
